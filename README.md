"The Internet can be a dangerous place when used without causion. Hackers could steal
your data, impersonate people you know or do much worse. But with the right tutor at
your site, you can learn the correct and safe usage of the world wide web. You can 
always ask him for help and always rely on him, because he's never gonna give you up,
never gonna let you down! Never gonna run around and desert you! Never gonna make you
cry, never gonna say goodbye! Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you!"
